# RFC-38: Promote JinnyYi as go-storage Maintainer

## Background

[JinnyYi](https://github.com/JinnyYi) is an active contributor of go-storage and related services since April. Due to her great contributions, we nominate her as go-storage committer in [#7](https://github.com/beyondstorage/community/pull/7). Since then, she has improved her personal skills and project understanding.

She has drafted and implemented following go-storage proposals:

- [GSP-654: Unify List Behavior](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/654)
- [GSP-700: Config Features and DefaultPairs via Connection String](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/700)
- [GSP-706: Support HTTP Signer](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/706)

## Proposal

So I propose to promote [JinnyYi] as go-storage maintainer, responsible for all project matters of go-storage along with [xxchan].
