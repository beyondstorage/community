# RFC-56: Promote BeyondCTL as new Project

## Background

As described in [BeyondStorage 2021Q4 Roadmap](https://beyondstorage.io/blog/2021/09/26/2021q4-roadmap), our community will focus on BeyondCTL this winter. So it is no longer appropriate to consider beyondctl as a project under go-storage.

## Proposal

So I propose to promote BeyondCTL as new project.

After this change, `BeyondCTL` will become the third project under BeyondStorage.

We will add three new teams around `BeyondCTL`:

- `beyond-ctl-maintainer`
- `beyond-ctl-committer`
- `beyond-ctl-reviewer`
